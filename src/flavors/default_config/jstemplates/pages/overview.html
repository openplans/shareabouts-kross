<p>Following the tragic death of Lucian Merryweather, Make Brooklyn Safer is organizing with community members to attend the 88th Precinct Community Council on November 19th, to demand that they address unsafe behavior and conditions for pedestrians and bikers on our streets. We will use your comments to demonstrate where the biggest problems are.</p>

<p>Please use this map to report issues you have had as a pedestrian or biker with: unsafe intersections, blocked crosswalks, drivers failing to yield, short light cycles, speeding drivers, and any other street-related problems you encounter around our neighborhood.</p>
